# Project Structure

In this section we use the helloreact React app that we created in the chapter 2 (Create React App section). Open the helloreact folder with VS Code (File --> Open Folder...). The project structure should look like the image below.

The `src` folder contains the source code and the main component that is called `App`. Open the App.js file to the code editor.

The first three lines of the App.js file contains `import` statements. The import statement is used to import javascript modules or other React components into the file. For example, the following line impoers React library from the node_modules folder. All dependencies are loaded into the `node_modules` folder and if you open that folder, you can find the react library there.

```javascript
import React from 'react';
```

The `import` can be also used to impoer stylesheets or assets, as you can see from the line 2 and 3. The second line imports logo image and `./` at the beginning of the filename means that the file is in the same folder than App.js. <br/>

Line 26 contains `export` statement. You have to export component that you can import it to some other component. <br/>

The lines 5-24 contain the React component code. It is just a simple component that contains the `return` statement that defines how the component looks like. <br/>

From the `src` folder, you can also find `index.js` file. You can see the content of the file in teh image below.

In the line 4 we import the `App` component from the App.js file. Then we use `ReactDOM.render` dunction to render the component in the HTML file (lines 7-12). The ReactDOM.render function gets two arguments. The first one is a component that we want to render. The second one is the HTML element where a component will be rendered. In this case, it will be rendered to an element that has id toor. The HTML file can be found from the public folder of your React project and the file is called inder.html. You can find the dive element from that file with the id root and that is the element wehere our App component is rendered.

```html
<div id="root"></div>
```
