# Hellow World

---

Let's modify our App component. Open the App.js file in the code editor and remove all code from the first div element in the return statement. Now, your source code should look like the code below. Save your changes and the browser should refresh automatically and you should see the empty page in the browser. Create React App contains hot reload functionality that refresh the browser automatically when your source code has been modified and saved.

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import logo from './logo.svg';
import './App.css';

function App() {
	return <div className='App'></div>;
}

export default App;
```

**Note!** After you have removed the code inside the div element, you can see that logo import (line 2) changes to pale in the VS Code editor. If you hover your mouse to the line, you can see warning 'logo' is declared but its value is never read. We removed the logo from the render statement and we should also remove the import because the logo is not used anymore.

After you have removed the line 2 (logo import), add text Hellow World inside the `div` element and save your file.

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import './App.css';

function App() {
	return <div className='App'>Hello World</div>;
}

export default App;
```

Now, the browser should look like the following image.
