# Counter Example

---

Now, we will create counter app that demonstrates how states works. Counter app has one button and when the button is pressed, the state is incremented by one. The value of state is shown in the browser. Below is the screenshot of the counter app. <br/>

Create a new React project by typing the following command in the terminal.

```javascript
npx create-react-app counter
```

Next, move into the folder.

```javascript
cd counter
```

Finally, start the project.

```javascript
npm start
```

Open the project with the VS Code and open App.js file in the code editor. Remove all code inside the return statement's outermost div element. Your App.js code should now look the following and the browser page should be now empty white.

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import './App.css';

function App() {
	return <div className='App'></div>;
}

export default App;
```

Let's add one state called `count` to our component. Add also import for the `useState` hooks. The initial value of `count` state is zero and you can modify its value by using the `setCount` method.

```javascript
import React, { useState } from 'react';
import './App.css';

function App() {
	const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

	return <div className='App'></div>;
}

export default App;
```

Next, we will add the button element to our component. We also add text to show `count` state value.

```javascript
import React, { useState } from 'react';
import './App.css';

function App() {
	const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

	return (
		<div className='App'>
			You have pressed the button {count} times
			<br />
			<button>Press me</button>
		</div>
	);
}

export default App;
```

Now, your browser should look like the image below. Nothig happens, yet if you press the button.<br/>

Next, we will add onclick event handler to the button. That can be used to execute javascript code when the button is pressed. In this case, we will use `setCount` method to increment `count` state by one. In the React, onclick should be written using the camelCase notation (onClick).

```javascript
import React, { useState } from 'react';
import './App.css';

function App() {
	const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

	return (
		<div className='App'>
			You have pressed the button {count} times
			<br />
			<button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Press me</button>
		</div>
	);
}

export default App;
```

**Note!** Now, when you press the button, you can see that new counter value can be seen immediately in the browser. You don't have to worry about updating the use interface. When the value of the count state is updated, the use interface will be re-rendered automatically by React. Finally, your app should look like the image below.

Open the browser's console (F12 or CTRL+Shift+i) and now, you should see two new tabs called Components and Profiler. These are provided by the React Developer Tools that we installed in the previous section. Activate the Components tab and click the App component in the left side of the tab. Now you should see the count state value in the right side of the tab. Now, if you click the button, the state will change also in the developer tools.

**Note!** It is very important to know that state updates are asynchronous, therefore the time for the updates might vary. In the counter example the state update depends on the current state value (setCount(count + 1)). In this case, we can't be sure that the update uses the current value of the count state. In this cases it is recommended to use useReduce() hooks instead. In this course we are not going through the useReduce() hooks because this case is not so common. <br/>

Next, we will see how state behaves when we render multiple counter component. Open the index.js file and render App component three times like in the code below.

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import './index.css';
import App from './App';
import * as serviceWorker from './serviceWorker';

ReactDOM.render(
	<React.StrictMode>
		<App />
		<App />
		<App />
	</React.StrictMode>,
	document.getElementById('root')
);
```

Now, you should see three counters in the btowser like show in the following image. <br/>

Next, you can test what happens if you press any of the counter buttons. If you press the second button, only the second counter state increments. It means that all of the three counter component instances have their own independent state. That is really important to understand. <br/>

Open also React Developer Tools and you can see that now there is three App component instances and if you click any of the components, you can see its state value.<br/>
