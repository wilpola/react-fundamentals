# Todo App

---

Let's now code one exampel React app where you can add new todos in to the list and remove these when the task is done. Create a new React app called todolist by typing the following command in the terminal.

```javascript
npx create-react-app todolist
```

Then move into the todolist folder and start the project by using the following commands.

```javascript
cd todolist
npm start
```

Open the project folder with VS Code and opent App.js in the editor. Remove all code inside the outermost `div` element and your App.js file code should look the following, **Note!** Keep the developer console open when developing to see possible error messages.

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import './App.css';

function App() {
	return <div className='App'> </div>;
}
export default App;
```
