# Component

---

In the past, the most common way to create components was by using classes. React.Component is abstract base class that will be typically subcalsses by your own components. The `render` method defines how your component looks like. The example below, renders text Hello world.

```javascript
class HelloComponent extends React.Component {
	render() {
		return <div>Hello world</div>;
	}
}
```

Nowadaus, the components are mostly created using the dunctions and this is the way we are using during this course. The `return` statement defines how component is rendered (How it looks like). The following example code also renders text Hello world.

```javascript
function HelloComponent() {
	return <div>Hello world</div>;
}
```

As you can see, you have to write less code when using function components. The only mandatory thing in the function component is the `return` statement.
