# Arrow function
----
The traditional way to create functions in Javascript is to use ``function`` keyword like shown in the code below.

```javascript
function(x, y) {
    return x * y;
}
```
<br/>

The ES6 introduced the arrow notation for the function (``=>``). The left side of the arrow, you define the parameters that are passed into the function. The right side of the arrow defines the return statement. The function above can be written as an arrow function like in the following example.

```javascript
(x, y) => x * y;
```
<br/>

If you have only one parameter, you don't have to use parentheses.
```javascript
x => 2 * x;
```
<br/>

If there is no parameters, you should have empty parentheses.

```javascript
() => {
    // Do something
}
```
<br/>

These examples are so called anonymous functions and you can't call these. They are typically used as callback functions in Javascript. You can also name your functions by saving it to variable, like show in the code below.
```javascript
const calc = (x, y) => x * y;
```
<br/>

Now, you can call it, for example ``calc(5, 6)``.
