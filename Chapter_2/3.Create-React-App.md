# Create React App

You can create a new React project by typing the following command in the command prompt or terminal.

```javascript
npx create-react-app myproject
```

<br/>

Create React App creates a new folder that is named according to the project name. Next, you have to move to the project folder and then start th project using the npm.

```javascript
cd myproject
```

**Note!** There are other package managers available like Yarn that you can use, but the commands might differ. During this course, we will use Npm.<br/>

Let's createour first project called helloreact by typing the following command in the terminal.

```javascript
npx create-react-app helloreact
```

Move to the project folder and start the app using the following commands.

```javascript
cd helloreact
npm start
```
