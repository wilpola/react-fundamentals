# State & Props

---

There are two types of data tha treact components "listen" or react to: **state** and **props**. The props and state are one of the most important things to understand when developing with the React Library. <br/>

Props are derived from teh parent compoennt and they are not going to hcange during the lifetime of the component. THe props are just parameters that are given to the component when it is created. <br/>

State is used for the date model that is going to change. <br/>

**NOTE!** The React component is automatically re-rendered when the state or props are changed.
