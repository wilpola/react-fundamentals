# Styling React Components

---

You can use inline styling with the React by using the `style` attribute. The following example code set div's height to 20%.

```javascript
function App() {
	return <div style={{ height: '20%' }}>Hello World</div>;
}
```

**Note!** The stule definition should be wrapped within two curly braces. <br/>

The style attributes should be written with camelCase in React inline styling. For example css attribute `font-size` is `fontSize` in React. <br/>

The CSS classes are more recommended duo the perdormance and maintainability. In React you can use CSS classes by using the `className` attribute. You have already seen that in our Hello World class that we did in the previous section. You might also notices that Hello World text was aligned to the center in the browser. In the code, we can see that name of the CSS class is App in the `div` element. We have also imported App.css file that is in the same folder than the App.js file.

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import './App.css';

function App() {
	return <div className='App'>Hello World</div>;
}

export default App;
```

Open the App.css file from the serc folder to the VS Code editor. THere you can find App class that defines `text-align` value to `center`. Therefore, the Hello World text is centered.

```css
.App {
	text-align: center;
}
```

Let's make some changes to the App class. Add one attribute to the App class that changes the background color to lightblue.

```css
.App {
	text-align: center;
	background-color: lightblue;
}
```

Save the CSS file and you should see the changes immediately in teh browser.
