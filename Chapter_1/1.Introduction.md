# Introduction

Javascript is based on ECMAScript that is standard for script languages. ECMAScript 2015 or ES6 introduced lot of new useful features to Javascript. These features makes also React development easier and code more readable. In this chapter we will go through some of the features that we will use in this course.

It is also good to know that all browsers doesn't support the latest ECMAScript features and you have to be careful when using these. Fortunatelly there is Javascript compiler called Babel (https://babeljs.io/) that can compile newer styl code to the older style code that is compatible with all modern browsers. Later in this course, we will use create-react-app tool to create our React projects and babel works there under the hood.
