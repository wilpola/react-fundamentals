# Installation

---

React Router (https://reactrouter.com/) is the component library that can be used to create navigation to your React app. It contains multiple navigational components that we will go through in the next section. Let's first create a React app and install the React Router library. <br/>

Create React app that is called reactrouting by typing the following command in the terminal.

```javascript
npx create-react-app reactrouting
```

Next, we will install the React Router library by using the npm. Before the installation, you have to move to the project folder by typing the following commands in teh terminal.

```javascript
cd reactrouting
```

Finally, we will install the React Router by typing the following command.

```javascript
npm install react-router-dom
```

The React Router can be used for the web app and mobile apps (React Native). The react-router-dom library is for the web apps. We will continue with this project at the end of this chapter. In the next section we will go through the different navigational components that React Router provides.
