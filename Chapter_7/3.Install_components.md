# Install Components

---

In the chapter 'Reading user input / Todo app' we created todo app and we used HTML table to render todo items. It woud be nice to get sorting, filtering etc. features to our todo table. In this example, we will use Ag-grid (https://www.ag-grid.com/) component in our todo list app. In this course, we use Ag-grid community component that is free to use (MIT license). <br/>

```javascript
npx create-react-app todogrid
cd todogrid
```

Open the project with VS Code and copy the following code into your project's `App.js` file.

```javascript
import React, { useState } from 'react';
import './App.css';

function App() {
	const [todo, setTodo] = useState({ description: '', date: '', status: '' });
	const [todos, setTodos] = useState([]);

	const inputChanged = (event) => {
		setTodo({ ...todo, [event.target.name]: event.target.value });
	};

	const addTodo = () => {
		setTodos([...todos, todo]);
		setTodo({ description: '', date: '', status: '' });
	};

	return (
		<div className='App'>
			<input
				placeholder='Description'
				name='description'
				value={todo.description}
				onChange={inputChanged}
			/>
			<input
				placeholder='Date'
				name='date'
				value={todo.date}
				onChange={inputChanged}
			/>
			<input
				placeholder='Status'
				name='status'
				value={todo.status}
				onChange={inputChanged}
			/>
			<button onClick={addTodo}>Add</button>
			<table>
				<tbody>
					{todos.map((todo, index) => (
						<tr key={index}>
							<td>{todo.description}</td>
							<td>{todo.date}</td>
							<td>{todo.status}</td>
						</tr>
					))}
				</tbody>
			</table>
		</div>
	);
}

export default App;
```

Now, we have three input fields in our todolist: description, date, and status. Your app should look like the following image. <br/>

Next, we will install Ag-grid component to our project. The installation instructions can be found from the component's documentation. In general, the installations are done by using the `npm install component_name` command. The `npm install` command install dependencies in your project's `node_modules` folder. The installation instruction of the Ag-grid component can be found from https://www.ag-grid.com/react-grid/. The installation is done as project wise, therefore you have to execute install command in your project's root folder. Open your terminal in your todogrid app folder and type the following command to install Ag-grid component. Note! If your project is running, you can stop the service by pressing Ctrl-C in the terminal.

```javascript
npm install ag-grid-community ag-grid-react
```

The command above installs Ag-grid components into the `node_modules` folder. Open the **package.json** file with the VS Code editor. Now, you can see that there are ag-grid components in teh `dependencies` section. THere is also a version number of the installed component and that might be different in your file.

```json
{
  "name": "todogrid",
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "private": true,
  "dependencies": {
    "@testing-library/jest-dom": "^5.11.4",
    "@testing-library/react": "^11.1.0",
    "@testing-library/user-event": "^12.1.10",
    "ag-grid-community": "^24.1.0",
    "ag-grid-react": "^24.1.1",
    "react": "^17.0.1",
    "react-dom": "^17.0.1",
    "react-scripts": "4.0.0",
    "web-vitals": "^0.2.4"
  },
```

The package.json file is like recipe for your React project and it contains all dependencies that are needed to run your project. You can also specify the version of the installed component by using the following command `npm install component_name@version`. If you execute `npm install` command without any component name, it will install all dependencies that are defined in the package.json file. <br/>

In the next section, we will use Ag-grid component in our todogrid project.
