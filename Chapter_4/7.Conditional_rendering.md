# Conditional rendering

---

With conditional rendering, you can define what will be rendered according to some state value. <br/>

You can, for example, render different component according to some state's value like shown in the next example. If the value of some state is grater than 5, MyComponent is rendered, otherwise YourComponent is rendered.

```javascript
function App() {
	if (someValue > 5) {
		return <MyComponent />;
	}

	return <YourComponent />;
}
```

You can also use inline syntax and only one return statement. Let's modify our counter example and use conditional rendering there. Our goal is to render text 'You have pressed the button more than 10 times' if the count state value is greater than 10. Otherwise, it will render the counter value like in the previous example. As you can remember, we can embed javascript into the return statement's html by using JSX (curly braces). You can use if statement or conditional operator (?) as shown in the code below.

```javascript
import React, { useState } from 'react';
import './App.css';

function App() {
	const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

	return (
		<div className='App'>
			{count <= 10 ? (
				<p>You have pressed the button {count} times</p>
			) : (
				<p>You have pressed the button more than 10 times</p>
			)}
			<button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Press me</button>
		</div>
	);
}

export default App;
```

Now, you can see the follwoing text when you have pressed the button more than 10 times.
