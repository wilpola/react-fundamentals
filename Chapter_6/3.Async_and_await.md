# Async and await
----

The async/await keywords are optional way to handle asyncronous operations (Like `then()` method in the previous section). In this course we use `then()` method but async/await is also used a lot therefore it is good to know basics of it. <br/>

The function that contains asyncronous operation should be market with the `async` keyword.

```javascript
const fetchData = async () => {
    // Asyncronous operations
}
```

Then, each asyncronous operation should have `await` keyword.

```javascript
const fetchData = async () => {
    const data = await networkCall();
    alert('Done' + data);
}
```
Error handling can be done using the try - catch like shown in teh example below.

```javascript
const fetchData = async () => {
  try {
    const data = await networkCall();
    alert('Done' + data);
  } 
  catch (err) {
    alert(err);
  }
}
```
